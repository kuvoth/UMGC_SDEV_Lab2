This was a project that implemented the string, secrets, datetime, and math modules. The purpose of the project was to allow the user to choose from 5 different options:

1. Calculate the volume of a cylinder
2. Use the law of cosines to determine the length of a line in a triangle given the length of 2 other lines and an angle
3. Calculate the days remaining until a specific date set in the program which was July 4th, 2025
4. Calculate the percentage to a certain decimal precision given a user input of a numerator, denominator, and level of precision
5. Generate a password given a number of constraints

The program also makes use of input validation and error checks using exceptions and value errors.
